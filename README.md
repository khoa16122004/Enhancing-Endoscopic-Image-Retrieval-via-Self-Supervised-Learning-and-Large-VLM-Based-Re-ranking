## Overview
Our work aims to:
- Enhance understanding and analysis of endoscopic images for retrieval tasks.
- Explore the capabilities of **Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** in understanding endoscopic images and re-ranking retrieval results.
- Combine **self-supervised learning** with **VLM-based re-ranking** to enhance the performance of Endoscopic Image Retrieval.


## Achievements
üèÜ **ENTRep Challenge @ ACM Multimedia 2025**
- **Top-2** in **Track 3** (Image-to-Text Retrieval)  
- **Top-5** in **Track 2** (Image-to-Image Retrieval)
